1.0 - 1.1  Compatible with ez4.1.0

- Changed all instances of eZDOMDocument to DOMDocument since lib/ezxml went
  away.

- Added a filecheck template operator which will do a file_exists so it's
  possible to display a link only if the file exists.  This new functionality should
  be backward compatible to existing collected information.
  syntax: {if eq($attribute.data_text|filecheck,true)}

- Added the check to collectinfo to only send the multi-part mail if there
  is a file attachment.
