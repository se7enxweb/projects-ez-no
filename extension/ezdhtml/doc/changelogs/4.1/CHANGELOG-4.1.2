Changes from 4.1.1 to 4.1.2
---------------------------

- Implemented suggestion #8571: Inline checkbox and embed inline problems.
  Added setting:
    site.ini:[EmbedViewModeSettings].InlineViewModes
  It contains a list of object's views that are "inline". (i.e. can be rendered
  inside paragraph)
  "Inline" checkbox of the "Insert Object" dialog is readonly now and it's
  value is determined automatically by this setting.
  
- The view selected by default in "Insert object" dialog is now the first element
  of AvailableViewModes list
  (setting site.ini:[EmbedViewModeSettings].AvailableViewModes).
