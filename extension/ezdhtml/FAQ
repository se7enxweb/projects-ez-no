eZ Online Editor extension 4.3.1 FAQ

1. eZ Online Editor is not activated in eZ publish
==================================================

You will need to check if the extension is properly activated in site.ini.
Open 'settings/override/site.ini.append(.php)' and find the 'ExtensionSettings'
section. Under it you should have an entry that says:

ActiveExtensions[]=ezdhtml

Make sure there are no spaces before or after the name.

You should also consider checking the debug output of eZ publish to see what is
going wrong.


2. After installation, I only get Disable editor/Enable editor button when
   editing an article, no any other changes.
==========================================================================

A. Make sure you have correct apache rewrite rule. Have you restarted apache
   after changes?

   Example of the rewrite rule for Apache:
   Rewriterule ^/extension/[^/]+/design/[^/]+/(stylesheets|images|javascripts?)/.* - [L]

B. Make sure you are using one of the following web browsers: 
   Internet Explorer 5.5 or higher, 
   Mozilla 1.3 or higher, 
   Firefox 1.0 or higher, 
   Netscape 7.x or higher.
     
   (It is always recommended to use the latest available version of the browser)
   
   Make sure that Javascript support is enabled in your web browser.


3. After installation, I see nothing have been changed when editing an article.
===============================================================================

A. Check your installation path. The correct path should like following:
   eZpublish Root  - kernel
                   - lib
                   - doc
                   - bin
                   - design
                   - ...
                   - extension - ezdhtml - modules
                                         - design
                                         - ezxmltext
                                         - settings
                                         - ...
B. Have you changed  ActiveExtensions[] to ActiveExtensions[]=ezdhtml
   in site.ini?

C. Make sure you have cleared all the caches (both eZ publish and browser).


4. When I insert an image into the editor, it does not show the real image, but
   only an icon.
===============================================================================

Check the 'extension/ezdhtml/settings/site.ini.append.php' file, find line

ImageClassID[]=your_image_class_id

under [MediaClassSettings]. Is the image class id correct?

Note: The ImageClassID setting is deprecated. Use the ImageClassIdentifiers
   setting instead in the same [MediaClassSettings] section.


5. When I insert an image into the editor, it disappears after storing.
=======================================================================

Are you trying to insert image right before or after heading?
Note that images/objects can't be saved in the same line as heading.


6. I click right mouse button on the selection, but see no 'Properties' there.
==============================================================================

To view element's properties you should not select anything, just place the
cursor inside it's inner text and right-click there.
