Installing eZ Online Editor extension
=====================================

1. Download the OE package.

   eZ publish Online Editor is licensed under the eZ proprietary license, which
   means that you need a separate license key for each website you use it for.
   If you have a valid OE license you can log in to ez.no and download the
   latest version at http://ez.no/download/add_ons/online_editor

   Windows users should download the "zip" package. Linux/UNIX users may
   download any package format as long as the necessary unpacking tools are
   available.

2. Copy the downloaded package into the 'extension' directory of your
   eZ publish installation.

3. Unpack the files in the distribution.

   Windows users should unzip the files. The 'ezdhtml' directory will be created
   inside the 'extension' directory.

   Linux users may use of the following commands depending on the file type:
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf ezoe-extension-4.3.1.tar.gz
   [bz2]:
   $ tar -jxvf ezoe-extension-4.3.1.bz2
   [zip]:
   $ unzip ezoe-extension-4.3.1.zip

4. Enable the OE extension in eZ publish.

   To enable OE for all of your siteaccesses, log in to your eZ publish
   administration interface, click on the 'Setup' tab, and then click
   'Extensions' on the left. You will see the list of available extensions.
   Select the 'ezdhtml' item and click the 'Apply changes' button.
   Aternatively, you can also edit the file 'site.ini.append.php' located
   in the 'settings/override' directory. Add the following line under
   the [ExtensionSettings] section:

   ActiveExtensions[]=ezdhtml

   Create the file and/or the section if they do not exist.

   To enable OE for only a single siteaccess, open the 'site.ini.append.php'
   file located in the 'settings/siteaccess/your_siteaccess' directory.
   Add the following line under the [ExtensionSettings] section:

   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=ezdhtml

   Create the file and/or the section if they do not exist.

5. Set the Image class

   In eZ publish, images are usually stored as Image objects. OE allows you
   to insert various objects into XML fields. OE uses the IDs of the image
   classes to determine whether the inserted object is an image or not.

   To check your Image Class ID, log in to your eZ publish administration
   interface, access the 'Setup' tab, and then click 'Classes' on the left.
   You will see the list of class groups. Select the 'Media' group and find
   the image class. The default ID of this class is 5 in a standard
   eZ publish installation. If your Image class ID is not 5, open the
   'site.ini.append.php' file located in the 'extension/ezdhtml/settings/'
   directory. Search for the following line under the [MediaClassSettings]
   section:

   ImageClassID[]=5

   Replace '5' with the value of the image class that your installation
   is using.

   If you have created different/additional image class, you can add these
   by extending the 'ImageClassID[]' configuration array. Add the following
   line under the [MediaClassSettings] section:

   ImageClassID[]=your_id

   Note: The ImageClassID setting is deprecated. Use the ImageClassIdentifiers
   setting instead in the same [MediaClassSettings] section.

6. Clear all the eZ publish caches.

   Log in to your eZ publish administration interface, select the 'Setup' tab,
   and then click the 'Clear all caches' button. If you use eZ publish 3.6
   or higher, you can also use the developer toolbar (if enabled) located
   in the right hand side. Simply select 'All caches' from the drop-down list
   and click the 'Clear' button.

   The other way to clear all caches is to remove the contents of 'var/cache/'
   and/or 'var/your_siteaccess/cache/' directory. This can either be done
   manually or by making use of a script.

   Linux users may launch the following script:

   $ ./bin/shell/clearcache.sh --clear-all

   If you have PHP CLI installed, you can also do the following (this script
   should also work on Windows):

   $ ./bin/php/ezcache.php --clear-all

7. Clear the browser caches

   Browsers usually cache visited pages in a folder somewhere. The next time
   the same pages are visited, they are loaded faster because some of the
   information already exists on the local storage device. If you already have
   OE installed and you're upgrading it then you will have to clear the
   browser's cache.
