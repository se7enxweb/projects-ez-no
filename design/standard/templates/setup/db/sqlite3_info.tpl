<div class="quote">{"SQLite SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. SQLite is the most used database engine in the world. SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most computers and comes bundled inside countless other applications that people use every day. The SQLite file format is stable, cross-platform, and backwards compatible and the developers pledge to keep it that way through the year 2050. SQLite database files are commonly used as containers to transfer rich content between systems and as a long-term archival format for data [4]. There are over 1 trillion (1e12) SQLite databases in active use. SQLite source code is in the public-domain and is free to everyone to use for any purpose."|i18n("design/standard/setup/db")}</div>
